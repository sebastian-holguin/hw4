## Mandelbrot.py

This file creates a mandelbrot fractal image. To use the python file:
1. Run the file.
2. The variable *mask* uses the function *mendelbrot(min occurances, max occurances, threshold)*
3. The more occurances, the better the image would look.

Once ran, the program will create an image named *mendelbrot.png* which determines how many points exist under the threshold.

## Markov Chain

This file creates a transposed array based on a previous array, dot product'd with an old array created when the program runs.
1. Run the file.
2. Use the function *markov_chain(size of vector, number of steps)* to create a markov chain.

Once ran, it'll produce the markov chain array after N steps.
